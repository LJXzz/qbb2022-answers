For DNA ailgnment:
The first sequence has 46 gaps  with no leading gaps and trailling gap;
The second sequence has 78 gaps with 1 leading gaps and 1 trailling gap;
(I am not sure if 'leading gaps' means gaps at the start and 'trailling gap' means gaps at the end?)
The alignment score is 266300.


For protein alignment:
The first sequence has 9 gaps with no leading gaps and trailling gap;
The secound sequence has 0 gaps;
The alignment score is 3801.
