Really nice work! Almost everything looks right. Just a few minor things:

1. I don't see your PCA plot, but I ran your code and it worked, so don't worry about it. Make sure you upload everything we ask for in the future though. (no points deducted)
2. I'm not entirely sure how you got your most significant SNP. For CB1908, I got rs10876043. And it doesn't look like rs17113501 is even significant for me. I'm not actually entirely sure what the sed and cut commands your running on the PCA output is meant to do, so I wonder if it has something to do with that. (-0.5)
3. Your boxplot code looks great, I think the reason your boxplot isn't showing a strong relationship is because your plotting a snp that isn't actually the top SNP. More importantly, you'll also want to make sure you're checking you're handling missing values correctly, which I'm not sure you are yet (-0.25)
4. You'll want to re-do question 7 with the updated top SNP once you're able to find it (no points deducted).

Very well done otherwise!
